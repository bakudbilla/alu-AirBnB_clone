This README provides a comprehensive overview of the HTML and CSS implementation for the Airbnb replica project. The primary goal of this project is to closely mimic the design and appearance of the real Airbnb website. By following a well-structured HTML layout and replicating the CSS styling, this project aims to create a visually similar experience for users.

The HTML files are organized to mirror the structure of the Airbnb website
The CSS stylesheets are designed to replicate the visual aesthetics of the Airbnb website. The styling is organized into modular components for easier maintenance and scalability.
